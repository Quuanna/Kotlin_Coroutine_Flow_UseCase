# Coroutine Use Case
1. Perform single network request
2. Perform two **sequential** network requests
3. Perform network requests **concurrently**
4. Perform Network requests timeout or retry
5. Room and Coroutines Perform "offline-first"
6. Coroutines Exception Handling
7. Continue Coroutine execution when the user leaves the screen
8. Using WorkManager with Coroutines

# Flow Use Case
1. Flow Basics
2. Basic Flow Intermediate Operators
3. Flow Exception Handling
4. Exposing Flows in the ViewModel

# based
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.

# Jetpack
- Lifecycle: Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
- ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room): for data storage persistence.
- [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager): for background scheduling needs.

# Construct the REST APIs And network data
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Retrofit supports coroutines suspend function after 2.6.0
- [Okhttp3](https://github.com/square/okhttp) 
  - interceptor: Implementation to judge various status display messages of Http Status Code, ex: 2xx Success, 3xx Redirection, 4xx Client Errors, 5xx Server Errors 

# Unit Test
- Retrofit mock: tests more readable & controllable, use Retrofit's mock web server just like how it is usedï¼Œ[mentioned by @JakeWharton](https://github.com/square/retrofit/issues/1413#issuecomment-168905741) 
- Okhttp3 mockserver: MockWebServer provides fake json, Mock fake Http Response, or request, response, header-related verification
- [coroutines test](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/test#additional-resources)
